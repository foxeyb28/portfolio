# portfolio
challenge #2
Have created a Portfolio with anchors setup to connect to the corresponding sections. 
I have added a link which will connect to my prework-study guide.
My contact info link works and will setup an email ready to send with choice of email site outlook etc.
I was able to get some styling done. 
My screen will adjust to the screen on different devices.
I have added a new project that I collaborated with my peers.
